Solved Problems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some problems are more complex than others. So we need to go through these problems in a particular order.
But given that I have already written lot of these problems already, i will try to add the new ones for now.
At some point, i will put the older ones in the list.
I am using this format - each program is given a number in multiples of 10. sometimes we write more than 1 class for the same problem.
So, if knapsack is 10, KnapsacklessSpace will be 11. CountingCoins will be 20 and so on. 

010. Knapsack.java : brute force and DP ( 2d array) solutions

011. KnapsackLessSpace.java : space optimal solution which uses a 1d array instead of 2d array

020. PartitionSet.java : partition into 2 subsets whose sum is equal

030. SubsetSum.java : Given a set of positive numbers, determine if there exists a subset whose sum is equal to a given number

040. MinDiffSubSets.java : Given a set of positive numbers, partition the set into two subsets with a minimum difference between their subset sums.

050. CountOfSubSets.java : Given a set of positive numbers, find the total number of subsets whose sum is equal to a given number ‘S’.

060. TargetSum.java : Given a set of positive numbers and a target sum ‘S’. Each number should be assigned either a ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign. We need to find out total ways to assign symbols to make the sum of numbers equal to target ‘S’.

070. UnboundedKnapsack.java : Same as knapsack, that we need to maximize profit. But we can use the same weight any number of times.

080. CountingCoins.java : Given an infinite supply of ‘n’ coin denominations and a total money amount, we are asked to find the total number of distinct ways to make up that amount.

090. MinCoinsCount.java : Given an infinite supply of ‘n’ coin denominations and a total money amount, we are asked to find the MINIMUM number of coins needed to make up that amount.

100. MaxRibbonsCut.java : We are given a ribbon of length n and a set of possible ribbon lengths. Now we need to cut the ribbon into the maximum number of pieces

110. Fibonacci.java

120. StairCase.java : Given a stair with â€˜nâ€™ steps, implement a method to count how many possible ways are there to reach the top of the staircase, given that, at every step you can either take 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps.

130. NumberFactors.java : Given a number ‘n’, implement a method to count how many possible ways there are to express ‘n’ as the sum of 1, 3, or 4.

140. CountMinJumps.java : Given an array of positive numbers, where each element represents the max number of jumps that can be made forward from that element, write a program to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array

150. CountMinFeeJumps.java : At every step you have the option to take 1,2 or 3 steps. And there is a fee/price to pay if you land at a particular step. Find minimum fees to pay.

160. HouseThief.java : Given a number array representing the wealth of n houses, determine the maximum amount of money the thief can steal without alerting the security system.

170. PalindromSubsequence.java : Longest Common subsequence

180. PalindromicSubstring.java : Longest common substring

200. Tiling a plot
This is exactly same as fibonacci series. So not writing a code here. Refer this link to understand the problem

210. WaysToScore.java : ways to score runs. based on permutations. Solved used recursion and DP

220. CountingPalindromes:

1. Given a plot of dimensions 3xN and tiles of dimentions 1x2, In how many ways can we arrange the plot?
ok, searched for this and found it to be very complex. Lets ignore.
